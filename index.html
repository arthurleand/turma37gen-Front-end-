        <p>
          Hi, my name is Arthur Leandro. I'm a fullstack java web developer, I
          graduated from Generation and I have skills in Java, SpringBoot,
          Mysql, JavaScript, HMTL, CSS, Angular and React.I consider myself an
          extrovert and very communicative. I can clearly say that my greatest
          quality is teamwork.I am also trained in computer networks, where I
          had my first contact with programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy playing online games, playing football and
          hanging out with friends.I live with my grandmother and very close to
          my mother, I can say that I have a very good family, I can't also
          forget about my little dog Lilly Potter who is my darling.
